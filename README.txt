Notice:

Before you install and use this plugin, please read the following notices carefully:

- Logged-in users will not trigger the caching process.
- A debug message will be appended to the end of the page's source code: `<!-- This page is cached by the Cache Master plugin. //-->`. This is intended for debugging purposes only, confirming that the page is being cached. This message can be disabled in the Settings page.

If you encounter issues with your website when using Cache Master, please report the problem on GitHub and list all plugins installed on your website. I'll investigate the problem and provide a fix.

== Installation ==

- Upload the plugin files to the /wp-content/plugins/cache-master directory, or install the plugin directly through the WordPress plugins screen.
- Activate the plugin via the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
- Navigate to the Cache Master menu in the Plugins section and configure your options.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Should I disable other cache plugins? =

Cache Master caches entire webpages into static HTML files. Therefore, it is recommended to disable other similar cache plugins that perform the same function. However, it can function alongside object cache plugins without issue.

= How can I determine whether the caching is working or not? =

Be aware that logged-in users will not trigger the caching process. To verify caching, use incognito mode or a different browser to revisit the same webpage, and then you can check the cache status in one of the following ways:

- View the source code of the webpage and check the debug message as shown in screenshot (L).
- Enable the benchmark information in the footer section as shown in screenshot (K), where you can see the cache status.

If there is no debug message in the source code, or if the cache status consistently displays 'No', there might be a plugin conflict with Cache Master that prevents it from working correctly.
